# Algo-Python

In my bachelor's, I had a subject named Analysis and Design of Algorithms, one of the most important subjects of computer science. And topics like recurrence relation, dynamic programming, greedy technique, and graph algos were there. 

I used multiple resources to learn this subject which consists including multiple youtube channels and books.

## Resources 
- This resources I personaly used and implemented. You will very easily grasp all the advanced topics by following this resources.

### Book

ðŸ“š Introduction to Algorithms AKA **CLRS**

Good book for understanding from the root. I used it while in BE-CSE.

- Just watch his videos you will easily grasp very tough algorithms like DP(Dynamic Programming), Divide and Conquer, Greedy Techniques, Graph algorithms, etc.
